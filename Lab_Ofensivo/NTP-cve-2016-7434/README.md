## Introduction

The purpose of this laboratory is to provide a controlled environment for testing and understanding the consequences of exploiting a known vulnerability in an NTP service. In this case, we are simulating an NTP service vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7434 security issue, which allows for a Denial of Service attack.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this laboratory environment, you'll need the following:

1. **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and use the laboratory environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```git clone https://github.com/agalvarado/DoS_Lab.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```cd DoS_LAb/Lab_Ofensivo/NTP-CVE-2016-7434```

3. Run the Docker container:

```docker run --rm -it --name ntpvulnerable -p 123:123/udp vulnerables/cve-2016-7434```

4. The vulnerable NTP service is now running and can be accessed on your local machine at 127.0.0.1:123.

5. Exploit vulnerability
    ``` ./exploit.sh 127.0.0.1 123 ```
## Exploiting CVE-2023-1234
To simulate the DoS attack exploiting the CVE-2023-1234 vulnerability, you can use various tools and techniques. Please exercise caution and ensure that you are operating within a controlled environment.

## Mitigation
To protect NTP services from CVE-2023-1234 and similar vulnerabilities, consider the following mitigation strategies:

1. Apply Security Updates: Regularly update the NTP server software to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

2. Firewall Configuration: Use firewalls to restrict access to your NTP service, allowing only trusted IP addresses to connect.

3. Network Monitoring: Implement network monitoring to detect and respond to unusual traffic patterns or DoS attacks.

4. Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Deploy an IDS to identify and block suspicious traffic targeting your NTP service.
